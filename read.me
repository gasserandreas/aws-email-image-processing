# AWS email image attachment processing

Receiving images as email attachment and process some image rekognition for further analysis

## Workflow
1. Receive emails with SES and saves email to S3
2. Triggers lambda function to process email and extract image attachment into separate S3 bucket
3. S3 copy triggers lambda function to start AWS StepFunction execution
4. Copy, analyse and inform + archive or just archive process image with StepFunction

Code is mixture of self written and modified source code from GitHub.
